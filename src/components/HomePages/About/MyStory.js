            My love/hate relationship with makeup is not unique, nor are any of
            my opinions on makeup. However, I still hope you can still find some
            value in the content I create for this website. Oh yeah, I am a full
            stack web developer and designed this website myself! It is still
            under construction, so please be easy on me while I work out the
            kinks! Thanks and enjoy :)
