            Nice to meet you. My name is Pam. Lover of all things beauty, I
            created this website to share my love and experiences with
            cosmetics, skincare, and haircare with the world. I have been
            wearing makeup since I was 12 years old (very young, I know) and
            it's been such a huge part of my life in good and bad ways. My
            love/hate relationship with makeup is not unique, nor are any of my
            opinions on makeup. However, I still hope you can still find some
            value in the content I create for this website. Oh yeah, I am a full
            stack web developer and designed this website myself! It is still
            under construction, so please be easy on me while I work out the
            kinks! Thanks and enjoy :)
